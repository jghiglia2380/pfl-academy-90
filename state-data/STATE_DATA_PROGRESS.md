## 🎯 Next Steps

### Remaining 46 States

**Tier 2 Priority** (High-population/early-adopter states):
- New York
- Pennsylvania
- Illinois
- Ohio
- Georgia
- North Carolina
- Michigan
- New Jersey
- Massachusetts
- Washington

**Tier 3** (All remaining states)

### Estimated Effort

**Per State**: 2-4 hours research and data entry

**Total Remaining**: 46 states × 3 hours avg = ~138 hours

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Process in batches of 5-10 states
2. Use Texas/California/Virginia/Florida as templates
3. Focus on required fields first, optional fields second
4. Run validation after each batch
5. Can be parallelized if multiple team members available

---

## 📝 Validation & Testing

### ✅ Completed:
- `validation/validate.js` - Automated validation script
- `validation/validation-results.json` - Validation output
- **Validation Results**: All 4 priority states passed (100% pass rate, 0 errors, 20 warnings)

### Validation Checks Completed:
- [x] All required fields present
- [x] Data types correct
- [x] Values in reasonable ranges
- [x] No placeholder text remaining
- [x] Last_updated within 12 months

### Still To Build:
- Test integration with Sebastian's template engine
- Verify {{VARIABLE}} replacement works correctly
- Optional: URL accessibility checks (use `--check-urls` flag for deep validation)

## 🔄 Annual Update Process

**Target Date**: September 1st each year (before fall semester)

**Critical Updates** (must do annually):
1. Public university tuition (`tuition_public`)
2. Minimum wage (`min_wage`) - changes frequently
3. Housing prices (`median_home_price`, `median_rent`)
4. Unemployment rate (`unemployment_rate`)
5. Gas prices (`gas_price_current`)
6. Tax rates (if changed by legislature)

**Data Sources by Category**:
- Automotive → State DMV websites
- Taxes → State revenue/comptroller sites
- Housing → US Census, Zillow, Realtor.com, state housing authorities
- Employment → Bureau of Labor Statistics (state data)
- Education → State higher ed commissions, College Board
- Banking → FDIC, state banking commissions

## 💾 File Sizes

- `schema.json`: ~8 KB
- Average state file: ~15-20 KB
- Total for all 50 states: ~1 MB (extremely lightweight)

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### For Sebastian's Team:

**Integration Steps**:
1. Platform identifies district's state
2. Load corresponding `states/{state_code}.json`
3. Parse JSON into key-value map
4. When rendering L-chapter markdown:
   - Find `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` patterns
   - Replace with value from state JSON
   - If variable not found, log error and show placeholder

**Example**:
```
Content: "Sales tax is {{STATE_SALES_TAX}}% in {{STATE_NAME}}"
State: texas.json
Output: "Sales tax is 6.25% in Texas"
```

**No Database Required** - Just file storage and template replacement engine.

## ❓ Questions for Discussion

1. **Remaining 46 states**: Should we prioritize certain regions/states?
2. **Update responsibility**: Who will own annual data updates?
3. **Validation**: Should we build validation script before continuing?
4. **Template engine**: Is Sebastian's team ready to begin integration with these 4 examples?

---

**Next Action**: Decide whether to:
- **Option A**: Build remaining 46 states now (138 hours)
- **Option B**: Build validation script and test with 4 states first
- **Option C**: Have Sebastian integrate with 4 states, then expand

**Recommendation**: Option B - Validate current 4 states work in platform, then proceed with remaining states in batches.
